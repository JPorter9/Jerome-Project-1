# Swish Basketball! 
![Swish logo](/assets/images/Swish%20Logo%20PNG%20.webp)

### Reason for site: 

I wanted to create a website for my local basketball team which I play for. This allows the players, fans and anybody that wanted to join the team to have access to a central area so that they can keep track of our team’s schedule, games that we’ve played and view pictures and potentially highlights of games that have been played already. 

### Font: 

As I want a sporty look, I want the font to be bold and simple rather than a fancy look as I want it to be easier to read. Roboto felt like the safest font and for headers I increased the boldness to thick 700. 

### Colour scheme: 
The colour-way should be orange - fb8500, blue - 03045e and white which represents our teams colours and logo which is displayed here. 

## Features 

### Home page: 

The home page should have our team news. Player of the game, results of the last game and details of our next game. There will be a display of a few pics showing highlights of our last game. 

### Roster: 

This page will display our coaching staff, team roster and a picture of both men's teams. The team roster includes player names, jersey number, height and age.  

### Schedule: 

This page will display the teams upcoming games, league schedule through an embedded link along with the league standings. 

 

### Join Swish: 

This page will have a sign-up form for new players enquiring about joining one of the teams, there is a select drop down element showing the 2 men's teams, U16’s and U12’s. For U16’s and U12’s there will be a message saying that a parent or guardian should be signing up for you. 

 

### Header: 

The header is very simple and basic as it doesn’t need many features or to be eye-catching. It is a base orange colour with the logo included that when you click on the logo it will revert you to the home page 

 

### Navigation Bar: 

Featured on all four pages, the full responsive navigation bar includes links to the Logo, Home page, Roster Page, Schedule Page and Join-Swish page and is identical in each page to allow for easy navigation. 

This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button. 

### Footer: 

The footer is very simple and tries to copy the header with the orange background. It shows 3 links to the social media pages, Facebook, YouTube and Twitter. 

 

### Potential features to add in the future:  

I would have like to add player profiles instead of a list in the Roster Page so it can show a headshot of a player with a link that goes to another page or a drop down displaying more info about them. It would also include a small highlight video of them playing across the games.  

I would also have liked a gallery page that has a individual folder of the pictures and videos taken for each game. 

 

### Bugs I fixed:  

When making the page live through GitHub pages I realised that all my CSS styling and images wouldn’t show. I realised the links had an extra / at the start which would break all the links in my code. After correcting them they would work live with no issues. 

 

### Bugs I couldn’t fix: 

With the news page embedded in the html from Facebook I couldn’t get it to work responsively with Bootstrap which meant it displayed awkwardly with smaller devices. After the project I will continue to test it in order to make it responsive for future use. 

## Validator Testing: 

### HTML 

No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator 

### CSS
